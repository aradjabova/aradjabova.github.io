What is the "right" decision? Do you and the next person have the same "right" decision? Probably not. When we are faced with making decisions not knowing what it is, is nerve-wracking. You can get stuck with the thoughts of picking the right choice or making a commitment without knowing the outcome. No one knows what the future will hold based on any decision you make. In the end, we cannot stay stagnant or nothing will change, so we do the best research we can and we commit to something blindly.

That is a quick summary of how I got here, enrolled in Flatiron, and no clue what is to come. Like many people I had no idea what I had wanted to do once graduating from school. I had always worked hard on earning my own money and with the help of my mother, I was able to start going to college. College was interesting, it had many options and different directions. For me, I couldn't commit to a choice because I was just lost. So for the next 3 years, I went to school for a semester and work full time for half the year to save to go back again. After three years of going back and forth with no real commitment to a degree or a direction, I didn't re-enroll again. Instead, I worked a different job, talked to many people in different fields, trying to find a place where I can grow and flourish with hope. 

It took 2 years of working and searching for me to realize I needed a place where I can be challenged and constantly developing. I am the type of person who truly loves to learn about new things and not improving or growing weighs heavy on a person like me. While on the hunt for something better I met 2 people who are in the data science field, these were people who were genuinely happy with what they do. They are people who talk about learning continuously at their job and had the freedom to choose what they wanted to do. I was intrigued. 

From then, I researched plenty about this field that has such promise and I couldn't be happier. This is a constantly developing field with many different areas and choices. A field that strived on math and tech and always changing. With that as my motivation, I searched for different degrees I would need, until one of the people I met suggested a boot camp. Thanks to that suggestion I looked online for different boot camps that were offered until I found Flatiron. After much research into the company and getting real people to feedback about them, I choose to make my decision. I worked three jobs to save money.

Now I am here, a few weeks into the program and no idea if I can do this. No idea if I made the right decision, but I made a decision that I'm committed to keeping. I'm not sure where this will go, but for me, this is the right decision that I put my hope in.
