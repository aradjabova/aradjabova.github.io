This is the final week at FlatIron, my Capstone has been submitted and I am starting to work with my Career Coach. It feels like the end of something I will always look back on and be grateful for. The beginning of the journey was very difficult as I didn't know if I was making the right choice in enrolling and devoting a big chunk of my time to going back to school. Currently, I have no regrets. This has been a truly crazy experience. 

I have never learned this much information in this short of time. Each month and module came with their headaches and frustrations and long nights, but it was an amazing experience. Each month that was overcome was a feat and truly unbelievable.  I couldn't believe that I had truly understood and was able to accomplish the amount that I did each time. 

Looking back for my final run of the modules, I remember how hard each section was and how many long hours I had spent trying to wrap my head around the topic and how fulfilling it was to finally run something that worked. Those tiny victories got me to now, in the last week of Flatiron with only a few days left.  

Thank you to all the teachers, but especially to Rafael, who is an awesome teacher that always took the time to get to know each of his students and find out the best ways to help them learn.  This has been a great adventure and something that I will be happy to have done.

I have no idea what the future will hold and where I am going to go from here, but I am excited and nervous to find out.  

Thank you
